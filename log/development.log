Ruby is a high-level general purpose programming language made by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto. It gained popularity during the early 20s because of Ruby on Rails, a server-side framework for web applications.   Why Learn Ruby? Ruby is one of the easiest programming language to learn and it's easy to learn as Python. The syntax for Ruby resembles the English language a lot. As Yukihiro Matsumoto puts it,   \"I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy\".   With Ruby, it's easier to focus on the concepts because the syntax is very simple compared to other programming languages. As a beginner, it's very important to be able to think like a programmer that's why it's important to learn using a simple language first in order to not discourage beginners. If you want to dive into web development, Ruby on Rails is your best bet because it's made with the same principle as Ruby.

As Yukihiro Matsumoto puts it, \"I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy\". With Ruby, it's easier to focus on the concepts because the syntax is very simple compared to other programming languages.

Ruby is one of the easiest programming language to learn and it's easy to learn as Python. The syntax for Ruby resembles the English language a lot. As Yukihiro Matsumoto puts it, \"I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy\". With Ruby, it's easier to focus on the concepts because the syntax is very simple compared to other programming languages. As a beginner, it's very important to be able to think like a programmer that's why it's important to learn using a simple language first in order to not discourage beginners.
